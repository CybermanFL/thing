XTool D1 PRO Firmware upgrade is not working. Followed step by step. Did on D1 Pro and on D1. Now neither one is working. All I have is in excess of $3000 in junk setting here 
not working and enough orders to put me in the black many times over.
I tried in XCS the rocket crashes every time. I tried in the D1 PRO Firmwre Tool  for Windows. The .bin file will load but when checked it fails. 
CAN ANYONE PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!
